# Dots
My dots for linux/hyprland

Those are my personal dots which i modified from JaKooLit (https://github.com/JaKooLit) for my OpenSUSE Linux / Hyprland configuration
Use at your own risk (look in to the files and change paths in scripts etc. because all of them have my path with my user login)

check out my ascii art caause this is the only thing i actually made myself!
